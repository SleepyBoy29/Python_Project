a: Psalms 18-19
a: Acts 20:17-38
p: Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
a: Exodus 7:7
p: Two grandmothers from Texas became media sensations recently for completing a journey around the world in eighty days at the age of eighty-one. The globetrotting best friends of twenty-three years traveled to all seven continents. They started in Antarctica, tangoed in Argentina, rode camels in Egypt, and took a sleigh ride while at the North Pole. They visited eighteen countries including Zambia, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Japan, and Italy and ended their trip in Australia. The duo said they hoped they’d inspired future generations to enjoy traveling the world, regardless of their age.
p: In Exodus, we read about two octogenarians who were recruited by God for a different kind of adventure of a lifetime. He called Moses to go to Pharaoh and demand he free God’s people from bondage. God sent Moses’ older brother Aaron for support. “Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:7).
a: Exodus 7:7
p: This request would feel daunting at any age, but God had handpicked these brothers for this assignment, and they followed His instructions. “So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded” (v. 10).
p: Moses and Aaron had the honor of witnessing God deliver His people from more than four hundred years of slavery. These men demonstrate that He can use us at any age. Whether we’re young or older, let’s follow Him wherever He leads.
