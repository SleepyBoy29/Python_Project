a: Ezekiel 1-2
a: Hebrews 11:1-19
p: Now choose life, so that you and your children may live.
a: Deuteronomy 30:19
p: Nathan grew up in a Christ-believing household, but he started to stray from his childhood faith as a college student into things like drinking and partying. “God brought me back to Himself when I didn’t deserve it,” he said. In time, Nathan spent a summer sharing Jesus with strangers on the streets of major US cities, and is now completing a residency in youth ministry at his church. Nathan’s goal is to help young people avoid wasting time not living for Christ.
p: Like Nathan, the Israelite leader Moses had a heart for the next generation. Knowing he would soon relinquish leadership, Moses delivered God’s good regulations to the people and then lists the results of either obedience or disobedience: blessing and life for obedience, cursing and death for disobedience. “Now choose life, so that you and your children may live,” he told them, “for the Lord is your life” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). Moses urged them to love God, “listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him” (v. 20).
a: Deuteronomy 30:19-20
p: Choosing sin brings consequences. But when we surrender our lives to God again, He’ll surely have mercy (vv. 2-3) and restore us (v. 4). This promise was fulfilled throughout the people of Israel’s history, but also by Jesus’ final work on the cross to bring us into fellowship with God. We too have a choice today and are free to choose life.
