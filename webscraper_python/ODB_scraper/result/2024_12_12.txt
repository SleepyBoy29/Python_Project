p: Bible in a Year :
a: Hosea 9-11
a: Revelation 3
p: She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
a: Luke 2:7
p: I loved my weekend in New Orleans—happening upon a parade in the French Quarter, visiting the National World War II Museum, and trying grilled oysters. But as I fell asleep in my friend’s spare room, I missed my wife and kids. I enjoy opportunities to preach in other cities, but I most enjoy being home.
p: One aspect of Jesus’ life that’s sometimes overlooked is how many of His most important events happened on the road. The Son of God entered our world in Bethlehem, an incalculable distance from His heavenly home and far from His family’s hometown of Nazareth. Bethlehem was overflowing with extended family in town for the census, so Luke says there wasn’t even a spare katalyma, or “guest room,” available (Luke 2:7).
a: Luke 2:7
p: What was missing at Jesus’ birth did show up at His death. As Jesus led His disciples into Jerusalem, He told Peter and John to prepare for their Passover meal. They should follow a pitcher-carrying man to his home and ask the owner for the katalyma—the guest room where Christ and His disciples could eat the Last Supper (22:10-12). There, in borrowed space, Jesus instituted what is now called Communion, which foreshadowed His looming crucifixion (vv. 17-20).
p: We love home, but if we travel with the Spirit of Jesus, even a guest room can be a place of communion with Him.
