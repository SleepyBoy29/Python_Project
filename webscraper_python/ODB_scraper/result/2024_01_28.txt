p: As I was grading another stack of papers for a college writing class I teach, I was impressed with one particular paper. It was so well-written! Soon, though, I realized it was too well-written. Sure enough, a little research revealed that the paper had been plagiarized from an online source.
p: I sent the student an email to let her know that her ruse had been discovered. She was getting a zero on this paper, but she could write a new paper for partial credit. Her response: “I am humiliated and very sorry. I appreciate the grace you are showing me. I don’t deserve it.” I responded by telling her that we all receive Jesus’ grace every day, so how could I deny showing her grace?
p: There are many ways God’s grace enhances our lives and redeems us from our errors. Peter says it gives salvation: “We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved” (Acts 15:11). Paul says it helps us not to be overtaken by sin: “Sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14). Elsewhere, Peter says grace allows us to serve: “Use whatever gift you have received . . . as faithful stewards of God’s grace” (1 Peter 4:10).
