p: His back is hunched, and he walks with a cane, but his many years of spiritual shepherding are evidence that he leans on God—the source of his strength. In 1993, the Reverend William Barber II was diagnosed with a debilitating disease that causes the vertebrae of the spine to fuse together. In a not-so-subtle way, he was told, “Barber, you probably gonna need to figure out another thing to do besides pastoring, because the church ain’t gonna want [someone disabled] to be their pastor.” But Barber overcame that hurtful comment. God has not only used him as a pastor, but he’s also been a powerful, respected voice for underserved and marginalized people.
p: Though the world may not fully know what to do with those with disabilities, God does. Those who value beauty and brawn and things that money can buy can miss the good that accompanies uninvited brokenness. The rhetorical question of James and the principle underneath it are worth considering: “Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?” (James 2:5). When health or strength or other things are reduced, one’s faith needn’t follow suit. By God’s strength, it can be the opposite. Our lack can be a catalyst to trust Him. Our brokenness, as was the case with Jesus, can be used of Him to bring good to our world.
