p: Bible in a Year :
a: 1 Chronicles 16-18
a: John 7:28-53
p: The eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.
a: 2 Chronicles 16:9
p: The Rocky movies tell the story of a raw boxer, fueled by never-say-die determination, who overcomes improbable odds to become heavyweight champion. In Rocky III, a now successful Rocky becomes impressed with his own achievements. Television commercials disrupt his time in the gym. The champ grows soft, and he’s knocked out by a challenger. The rest of the movie is Rocky’s attempt to regain his fighting edge.
p: In a spiritual sense, King Asa of Judah lost his fighting edge. Early in his reign, he relied on God in the face of daunting odds. As the mighty Cushites prepared to attack, Asa prayed, “Help us, Lord our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army” (2 Chronicles 14:11). God answered his prayer, and Judah struck down and scattered their enemies (vv. 12-15).
a: 2 Chronicles 14:11
p: Years later, Judah was threatened again. This time a complacent Asa ignored God and instead asked the king of Aram for help (16:2-3). It seemed to work. But God wasn’t pleased. The prophet Hanani told Asa that he’d stopped trusting God (vv. 7-8). Why hadn’t he relied on God now as he had then?
p: Our God is unfailingly reliable. His eyes “range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (v. 9). When we keep our spiritual edge—fully depending on God—we’ll experience His power.
