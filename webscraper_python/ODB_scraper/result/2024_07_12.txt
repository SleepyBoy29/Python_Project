p: Bible in a Year :
a: Psalms 4-6
a: Acts 17:16-34
p: God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
a: Ecclesiastes 12:14
p: A thief broke into a phone repair shop, smashed the glass of a display case, and began pocketing phones and more. He tried to conceal his identity from the surveillance camera by covering his head with a cardboard box. But during the burglary, the box briefly tipped, uncovering his face. Minutes later, the store owner saw the video footage of the robbery, called the police, and they arrested the robber outside a nearby store. His story reminds us that every hidden sin will be uncovered one day.
p: It's human nature to try to hide our sins. But in Ecclesiastes, we read that we should keep God’s commandments, for every hidden thing will be brought before His righteous gaze and just verdict (12:14). The author wrote, “Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind” (v. 13). Even the hidden things which the Ten Commandments rebuked (Leviticus 4:13) won’t escape His evaluation. He’ll bring every deed into judgment, whether good or evil. But, because of His grace, we can find forgiveness for our sins in Jesus and His sacrifice on our behalf (Ephesians 2:4-5).
a: Leviticus 4:13
a: Ephesians 2:4-5
p: When we’re conscious of and internalize His commandments, it can lead to a reverent fear of Him and a lifestyle to match. Let’s bring our sins to Him and experience anew His loving, forgiving heart.
