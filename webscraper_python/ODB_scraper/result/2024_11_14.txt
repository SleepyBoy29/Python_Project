a: Lamentations 3-5
a: Hebrews 10:19-39
p: They should always pray and not give up.
a: Luke 18:1
p: Mila, a baking assistant, felt too helpless to defend herself when her supervisor accused her of pilfering some raisin bread. The unfounded assertion and corresponding salary deduction were just two of many wrongful actions from her supervisor. “God, please help,” Mila prayed each day. “It’s so hard working under her, but I need this job.”
p: Jesus tells of a widow who also felt helpless and “sought justice against [her] adversary” (Luke 18:3). She turned to someone with the authority to resolve her case—a judge. Despite knowing that the judge was unjust, she persisted in approaching him.
a: Luke 18:3
p: The judge’s eventual response (vv. 4-5) is infinitely different from that of our heavenly Father, who quickly responds with love and help. If persistence could cause an unjust judge to take up a widow’s case, how much more can and will God, who is the just Judge, do for us (vv. 7-8)? We can trust Him “to bring about justice for his chosen ones” (v. 7) and being persistent in praying is one way of showing our trust. We persist because we have faith that God will respond in perfect wisdom to our situation.
p: Eventually, Mila’s supervisor resigned after other employees complained about her behavior. As we walk in obedience to God, let’s persist in praying, knowing the power of our prayers lies in the one who hears and helps us.
