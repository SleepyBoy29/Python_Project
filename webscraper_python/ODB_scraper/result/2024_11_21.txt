p: On November 22, 1963, US president John F. Kennedy, philosopher and writer Aldous Huxley, and Christian apologist C. S. Lewis all died. Three well-known men with radically different worldviews. Huxley, an agnostic, still dabbled in Eastern mysticism. Kennedy, though a Roman Catholic, held to a humanistic philosophy. And Lewis was a former atheist who as an Anglican became an outspoken believer in Jesus. Death is no respecter of persons as all three of these well-known men faced their appointment with death on the same day.
p: The Bible says that death entered the human experience when Adam and Eve disobeyed in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3)—a sad reality that has marked human history. Death is the great equalizer or, as one person put it, the appointment that no one can avoid. This is the point of Hebrews 9:27, where we read, “People are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.”
a: Genesis 3
a: Hebrews 9:27
p: Where do we find hope about our own appointment with death and what follows? In Christ. Romans 6:23 captures this truth perfectly: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” How did this gift of God become available? Jesus, the Son of God, died to destroy death and rose from the grave to offer us life forever (2 Timothy 1:10).
