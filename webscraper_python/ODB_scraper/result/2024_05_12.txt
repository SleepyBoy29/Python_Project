p: Bible in a Year :
a: 2 Kings 15-16
a: John 3:1-18
p: I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice.
a: 2 Timothy 1:5
p: As teens, my sister and I didn’t understand my mom’s decision to receive Jesus as her Savior, but we couldn’t deny the changes we saw in her. She had more peace and joy and began faithfully serving at church. She had such a hunger for studying the Bible that she attended and graduated from seminary. A few years after my mom’s decision, my sister accepted Christ and started serving Him. And a few years after that, I also placed my trust in Jesus and started serving Him. Many years later, my father joined us in believing in Him as well. My mom’s decision for Christ created a life-changing ripple effect among our immediate and extended family.
p: When the apostle Paul wrote his final letter to Timothy and encouraged him to persevere in his faith in Jesus, he noted Timothy’s spiritual heritage. “I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also” (2 Timothy 1:5).
a: 2 Timothy 1:5
p: Moms and grandmoms, your decisions can affect generations.
p: How beautiful that Timothy’s mom and grandmom helped nurture his faith so he could become the man God was calling him to be.
p: On this Mother’s Day and beyond, let’s honor mothers who’ve made a decision to follow Jesus.
p: Let’s also leave a spiritual legacy for our loved ones.
