p: Bible in a Year :
a: Judges 13-15
a: Luke 6:27-49
p: [Don’t give] up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but [encourage] one another.
a: Hebrews 10:25
p: When I went through an extended period of emotional and spiritual pain and struggle due to difficult circumstances in my life, it would have been easy for me to withdraw from church. (And sometimes I did wonder, Why bother?) But I felt compelled to keep attending each Sunday.
p: Although my situation remained the same for many long years, worshiping and gathering with other believers in services, prayer meetings, and Bible study supplied the encouragement I needed to persevere and remain hopeful. And often I’d not only hear an uplifting message or teaching, but I’d receive comfort, a listening ear, or a hug I needed from others.
p: The author of Hebrews wrote, “[Don’t give] up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but [encourage] one another” (Hebrews 10:25). This author knew that when we face hardships and difficulties, we’ll need the reassurance of others—and that others would need ours. So this Scripture writer reminded readers to “hold unswervingly to the hope we profess” and to consider how to “spur one another on toward love and good deeds” (vv. 23-24). That’s a big part of what encouragement is. That’s why God leads us to keep meeting together. Someone may need your loving encouragement, and you may be surprised by what you receive in return.
