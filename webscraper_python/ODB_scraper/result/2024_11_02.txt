p: Brad moved to a new city and quickly found a church where he could worship. He went to services for a few weeks, and then one Sunday he talked to the pastor afterward about his desire to serve in any way needed. He said, “I just want to ‘reach for the broom.’ ” He started by helping set up chairs for the services and cleaning the restrooms. The church family found out later that Brad’s giftedness was in teaching, but he was willing to do anything.
p: Jesus taught two of His disciples, James and John, and their mother a lesson in servanthood. Their mother requested that her sons have a place of honor on each side of Christ when He came into His kingdom (Matthew 20:20-21). The other disciples heard about this and grew angry with them. Perhaps they wanted those positions for themselves? Jesus told them that exercising authority over others wasn’t the way to live (vv. 25-26), but instead serving was most important. “Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant” (v. 26).
a: Matthew 20:20-21
p: Brad’s words “reach for the broom” are a practical picture for what each of us can do in our communities and churches to serve Christ. Brad described his life’s passion for God in this way: “I want to serve for the glory of God, for the good of the world, and for my own joy.” How will you and I “reach for the broom” as God leads us?
