p: Bible in a Year :
a: Jeremiah 32-33
a: Hebrews 1
p: Before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language.
a: Revelation 7:9
p: As the daughter of two loving and hard-working parents from Central and South America, I’m grateful they had the courage to be the first in their families to immigrate to the United States for better opportunities. They met as young adults in New York City, married, had my sister and me, and went on to run their respective businesses.
p: As a native New Yorker, I’ve grown up embracing my Hispanic heritage and have been fascinated with people of diverse backgrounds. For instance, I once shared my story of faith at an evening service at a multicultural church that meets in a former Broadway theater. Speaking to a multicultural group about God’s love is only a glimpse of what heaven will be like when we see people from different nations come together as the body of Christ.
p: In Revelation, the apostle John gives us this amazing picture of heaven: “Before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb” (Revelation 7:9). God our Savior will receive the “praise and glory” and so much more He’s worthy of “for ever and ever” (v. 12).
a: Revelation 7:9
p: Now we have just a glimpse of what heaven will be like. But one day, we who believe in Jesus will be united with Him and with people from different countries, cultures, and languages. Since God loves the nations, let’s also love our global family in Christ.
