p: Repent and be baptized . . . in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
a: Acts 2:38
p: Growing up together in Central Asia, Baheer and Medet were the best of friends. But when Baheer became a believer in Jesus, everything changed. After Medet reported him to government authorities, Baheer endured excruciating torture. The guard growled, “This mouth will never speak the name of Jesus again.” Though badly bloodied, Baheer managed to say that they might stop him speaking of Christ, but they’d never “change what He has done in my heart.”
p: Those words remained with Medet. Some months later, having suffered illness and loss, Medet traveled to find Baheer, who had been released from prison. Turning from his pride, he asked his friend to introduce him to his Jesus.
p: Medet acted on the conviction of the Holy Spirit in the same way that those who gathered around Peter on the feast of Pentecost were “cut to the heart” when they witnessed God’s outpouring of grace and heard Peter’s testimony about Christ (Acts 2:37). Peter called the people to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and some three thousand did. Just as they left their old ways of life behind, so too did Medet repent and follow the Savior.
a: Acts 2:37
p: The gift of new life in Jesus is available to everyone who believes in Him. Whatever we’ve done, we can enjoy the forgiveness of our sins when we trust in Him.
