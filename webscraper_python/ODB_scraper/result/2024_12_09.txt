a: Daniel 11-12
p: When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
a: Isaiah 43:2
p: It was a long day at the hospital. Still no answers to the sickness that afflicted a young, bright nineteen-year-old. Arriving home, the family felt discouraged. To their surprise, a nicely decorated box sat on the step with Isaiah 43:2 printed on the front. Inside, were assorted encouraging Bible verses that friends had written out by hand. The next hour was spent being encouraged by Scripture and the thoughtful gesture of the family’s friends.
a: Isaiah 43:2
p: People going through tough times or family challenges can always use a heartfelt boost. Scripture—either a large portion or just a verse—can encourage you, a friend, or family member. Isaiah 43 is filled with little bits of encouragement—received either individually or as a whole. Consider a few choice thoughts: God has “created you,” “formed you,” “redeemed you,” and called you “by name” (v. 1). God “will be with you” (v. 2), He’s “the Holy One of Israel,” and He’s our “Savior” (v. 3).
a: Isaiah 43
p: As you consider the promises of God, may they encourage you. And as He provides what you need, you can encourage someone else. The verse box didn’t cost a lot, but its impact was priceless. Even after five years, some of those verse cards are still cherished by the family.
