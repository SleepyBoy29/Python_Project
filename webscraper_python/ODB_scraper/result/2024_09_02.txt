p: Bible in a Year :
a: Psalms 137-139
a: 1 Corinthians 13
p: All the believers were together and had everything in common.
a: Acts 2:44
p: As our party approached, my wife and I started planning. With many people coming, should we pay a caterer to cook? If we do the cooking ourselves, should we buy a barbeque? With a small chance of rain on the day, should we buy a tent too? Soon our party was getting expensive, and even a little antisocial. By trying to provide everything ourselves, we were missing an opportunity to receive the help of others.
p: The Bible’s vision of community is one of both giving and receiving. Even before the fall, Adam needed help (Genesis 2:18), and we’re called to seek others’ advice (Proverbs 15:22) and share our burdens (Galatians 6:2). The early church held “everything in common,” benefiting from each other’s “property and possessions” (Acts 2:44-45). Instead of living independently, they shared, borrowed, gave, and received in beautiful interdependence.
a: Genesis 2:18
a: Proverbs 15:22
a: Galatians 6:2
a: Acts 2:44-45
p: We ended up asking guests to bring a salad or dessert to our party. Our neighbors brought their barbeque, and a friend brought his tent. Asking for help enabled us to forge closer relationships, and the food people made brought variety and delight. In an age like ours, being self-sufficient can be a source of pride. But God gives His grace “to the humble” (James 4:6), including those who humbly ask for help.
