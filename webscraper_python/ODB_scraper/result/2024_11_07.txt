p: I plead with Euodia and . . . Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
a: Philippians 4:2
p: Four of our grandkids were playing with a miniature train set, and the younger two were arguing over an engine. When our eight-year-old grandson began to intervene, his six-year-old sister stated, “Don’t worry about their business.” Wise words for us all—usually. But when the argument turned to tears, Grandma stepped in, separated, and comforted the squabbling children.
p: It’s good to stay out of others’ business when doing so could make matters worse. But sometimes we need to prayerfully get involved. In his letter to the Philippians, the apostle Paul provides an example of when to do so. Here he urges two women, Euodia and Syntyche, “to be of the same mind in the Lord” (4:2). Apparently, their disagreement had become so intense that the apostle felt compelled to intervene (v. 3), even though he was imprisoned (1:7).
p: Paul knew the women’s argument was causing disunity and taking focus away from the gospel. So, he gently spoke the truth while reminding them that their names were written “in the book of life” (4:3). Paul wanted these women and everyone in the church to live as God’s people in thought and actions (vv. 4-9).
p: When you’re unsure if you should get involved, pray, trusting that “the God of peace will be with you” (v. 9; see v. 7).
