a: Matthew 25:39
p: In the early 1800s, Elizabeth Fry was appalled by the conditions in a London women’s prison. Women and their children were crowded together and made to sleep on the cold stone floors. Although they weren’t given bedding, a tap flowed with gin. For years, she visited the prison and ushered in change by providing clothes, opening a school, and teaching the Bible. But many saw her biggest influence as her loving presence and clear messages of hope.
p: In her actions, she followed Jesus’ invitation to serve those in need. For instance, while on the Mount of Olives, Christ shared several stories about the end of the age, including one about the welcome of “the righteous to eternal life” (Matthew 25:46). In this story, the King tells the righteous people that they gave Him something to drink, invited Him in, and visited Him in prison (vv. 35-36). When they couldn’t recall doing so, the King responds: “Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me” (v. 40).
a: Matthew 25:46
p: What a wonder that when we serve others with the help of the Holy Spirit, we serve Jesus! We can follow Elizabeth Fry’s example, and we can also serve from home, such as through intercessory prayer or sending encouraging messages. Jesus welcomes us to love Him as we use our spiritual gifts and talents to assist others.
